monaco.ttf
==========

The original monaco.ttf improved: add some special charactors (which are from "DejaVu Sans Mono")

In my work environment, I need connect to Linux system from Windows system remotely using SecureCRT or Putty, and edit files using VIM tools. So I need one beautiful font in SecureCRT / Putty.

"Consolas" is good, but it can't support some special charactors, for example: ▸, ↪, ⌴. Because it is original font in my Windows, I don't want to modify it.
I get "Monaco" from web. It is tiny and beautiful. But it can't support some special charactors, for example: ▸, ↪, ⌴

So I add the charactors by myself and share it.
